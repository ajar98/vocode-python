# ðŸ¤« Vocode 0.0.156 Preview

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! If you're seeing this that means you've discovered the Vocode 0.0.156 Early Preview Repo!

Either we (Vocode) sent this your way or you are busy little bee and found it on your own, either way we want to reward your excellence in the Vocode community with this early preview of our work over the last few months AND to invite you to our private channel on our Discord [(Click here to join!)](https://discord.gg/MVQD5bmf49) so that you can have unfettered access to ask Vocode employees questions, get help, and even potentially contribute back to our 0.0.156 release!

If you're seeing this and don't have access to the new channels, please reach out to Mac, Ajay, George or really any other Vocode employee and we'll see that you do :)

We'd prefer if this stayed a relatively secret thing for now and that means while we acknowledge folks will share this repo to close friends, please try and keep this repo out of any public places as we're still hard at work getting this ready for public launch!
